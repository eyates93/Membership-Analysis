# Membership-Analysis
I was tasked with running an analysis to find all the customers with an active membership when they made a service call for an HVAC technician to come out to their home.

It was a seemingly simple ask, but due to their data structure, it wasn't easy to determine if a customer had an active membership agreement at the time of their service call.

This was my solution for analyzing the number of customers with active membership agreements during their service calls.
